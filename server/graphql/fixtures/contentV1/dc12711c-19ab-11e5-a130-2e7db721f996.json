In a country that has a spotty record in collecting taxes, that has raised concern among some of the creditors, as has the potential recessionary effect high new taxes could have on the economy.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick breakdown on where <a title=\"Greece debt crisis: In depth news, comment and analysis from the Financial Times\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/indepth/greece-debt-crisis\">Greece</a> has moved, and where the creditors stand, on the key issues still in dispute.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Primary surplus</h3>\n<p>This may be the most important metric to watch. The primary budget surplus — government revenues minus its expenses when interest on national debt is excluded — is the target that all other policies must eventually aim at. But it can also be misleading. Although the rival targets look surprisingly close, analysts believe the Greek plan will not actually produce the numbers it claims.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Creditors offer:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>The latest plan called for a surplus of 1 per cent of gross domestic product this year, a significant cut from the bailout’s current 3 per cent target. But since Greece is projected to post a 0.7 per cent deficit this year, that means a lot of austerity would be required. Greece would need to get to 3.5 per cent in 2018 via two steps: 2 per cent next year, and 3 per cent in 2017.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece was:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Originally, Greece was also targeting a surplus of 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2018, but it proposed taking a far more gradual approach to get there. This year, under its first counterproposal, Athens would have only needed to post a 0.6 per cent surplus, followed by 1.5 per cent next year and 2.5 per cent in 2017. Under pressure from Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, Greek negotiators then attempted to split the difference and called on creditors to meet them halfway.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece is now:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>The new Greek proposal accepts the creditors’ surplus targets in full. In order to hit those targets, it has tax increases and some spending cuts that will total 1.5 per cent of GDP this year and 2.9 per cent next year. It estimates that other administrative reforms will save 0.9 per cent this year and 1.3 per cent in 2016.</p>\n<p><img height=\"350\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/956f5346-19ed-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.img\"/>\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Pension reform</h3>\n<p>Possibly the most contentious issue of all, and the one on which Athens moved the most in its new proposal. The governing Syriza party campaigned on a promise to restore the “13th month” pension bonus payment to more than 1.2m pensioners receiving less than €700 per month. But the IMF, in particular, has stuck to a hard line, insisting the pension system post a “zero deficit”, which would prevent Syriza from fulfilling its campaign promise.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Creditors:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Their offer called for a series of cuts, that would lead to a reduction totalling 1 per cent of GDP, or about €1.8bn, by 2016 and 2017. These include “significantly tightening” early retirement rules, which provide incentives for a whole raft of workers to drop out of the workforce, and increasing the amount pensioners have to pay for healthcare.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece was: </span>\n</span>\n<br/>Just over a week ago, the only pension reform offered was cutting back on some of the early retirement schemes, saving a mere €71m next year. Under that plan, the effective retirement age would be gradually raised to 67, but that target would not be reached for another 20 years.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece is now:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>The new plan features a more aggressive attempt to raise the effective retirement age, promising “strong disincentives” for early retirement and targeting the retirement age of 67 by 2025, rather than 2036. That would save €300m next year, Athens estimates. Far bigger is a 3.9 per cent contribution increase to the main public sector pension plan, which will raise €800m next year, and hikes in healthcare contributions that would yield another €510m.  </p>\n<p><img height=\"350\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/e97041ac-19ee-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.img\"/>\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Value added tax</h3>\n<p>Greece has one of the lowest rates of VAT payment in the EU, a problem the European Commission has blamed on both widespread evasion as well as a complicated system with multiple exemptions for certain products and regions. Over the course of the crisis, collection rates have dropped even lower.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Creditors offer: </span>\n</span>\n<br/>The plan focused on increasing VAT revenues by 1 per cent of GDP by eliminating exemptions and simplifying rates to just two: a standard rate of 23 per cent, with a reduced rate of 11 per cent for essential items like food and medicines. Controversially, it would eliminate the exemption for Greek islands, which have fiercely resisted to protect a vital tourism industry. Meanwhile, electricity was included in the higher 23 per cent rate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece was:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Originally, Athens proposed three different rates rather than two — a “super-reduced” rate of 6 per cent for medicine and books. But electricity was kept in a lower 11 per cent bracket and there was no mention of what would be done for the special exemptions for Greek islands.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece is now:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Athens keeps the three-tier structure, but raises the middle rate to 13 per cent. It also narrows the products that are exempt from the standard 23 per cent rate — though importantly electricity remains in the middle bracket. In what would be a big concession, the document says Greece will “eliminate discounts, including on islands”. But officials say Mr Tsipras has backtracked in talks with creditors. </p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Taxes</h3>\n<p>Tax collection has long been the bane of the Greek programme. Preceding Greek governments have resorted to creative revenue-generating schemes that proved politically poisonous. In 2011, for example, the centre-left Pasok government implemented a new property tax that was added to electricity bills to ensure collection, which prompted a revolt. Syriza garnered campaign support by promising to end a new version of the property tax imposed by the centre-right government that followed. </p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Creditors offer:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Mindful of previous political firestorms, creditors did not seek additional new business, income or property taxes, but insisted that existing tax schemes not be rolled back. In addition, they demanded an end to tax amnesty schemes, which Greek governments have rolled out with regularity, creating significant disincentives for anyone to pay their taxes on time.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece was:</span>\n</span> <br/>Previous proposals were virtually mum on what the government intended to do regarding the hated property tax and instead began layering on a series of taxes against the wealthy and companies. These included a one-off tax on profits above €1m, an increase in the corporate tax rate from 26 per cent to 29 per cent, and raising the luxury tax on things like yachts and swimming pools from 10 per cent to 13 per cent.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece is now:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>The new proposal appears to maintain the current property tax regime through at least next year, promising to “safeguard the 2015 and 2016 property tax revenues at €2.76bn”. It also retains the increased corporate and luxury taxes, and goes a bit further on the one-time profits tax, which will now be 12 per cent on all profits above €500m. The new profits tax alone is estimated to raise €1.3bn over the next two years.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Privatisations</h3>\n<p>The Greek privatisation drive has been one of the biggest failures of the bailout programme. Four years ago, creditors predicted it would bring in €50bn in revenues. The last programme review, a year ago, predicted just half that. Syriza originally vowed to freeze all privatisations, but government leaders have gradually moved off that stance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Creditors offer:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>Pending privatisations would need to be approved quickly, including some regional airports, the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki, and the rail operator. The proposal retained an overall target of €22bn in total revenues, though it pushed back the target date from 2020 to 2022. Specific targets for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are left to be negotiated.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece was:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>\n</p><aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>For a government with ministers who still occasionally promise to kill any privatisation programme, the Greeks made surprising concessions. They suggested nearly €3.2bn could be raised through sales in the next two years, including €1.2bn from the regional airports, and another €2.1bn the following three years. It would fall short of the €22bn target by 2022, but not by much.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Where Greece is now:</span>\n</span>\n<br/>The latest proposal does not break out individual sales. But it appears to accelerate the privatisation programme significantly beyond previous offers. Although this year’s target remains €1.4bn, next year it promises to bring in €3.7bn — or more than double what Athens had promised in earlier proposals. In 2017, it is targeting €1.2bn in sales, when previously it was promising only €176m. </p>"},"lifecycle":{"initialPublishDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:30:08Z","lastPublishDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:30:08Z"},"location":{"uri":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dc12711c-19ab-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html"},"summary":{"excerpt":"Where Athens has moved, and where the creditors stand"},"packaging":{"spHeadline":"Breakdown of latest Greece proposals"},"master":{"masterSource":"Methode","masterEntityId":"dc12711c-19ab-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996"},"editorial":{"otherTitles":["Deal or no deal: Breakdown of proposals"],"subheading":"Where Athens has moved, and where the creditors stand","standFirst":"Where Athens has moved, and where the creditors stand","byline":"Peter Spiegel in Brussels"},"provenance":{"originatingParty":"FT"},"metadata":{"primarySection":{"term":{"name":"Europe","id":"OQ==-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},"primaryTheme":{"term":{"name":"Greece Debt Crisis","id":"ZmEzMmRmNDAtNDc0Zi00ODk3LWE2ZmQtZWFmYzJlZTRjZTVk-VG9waWNz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"topics"}},"tags":[{"term":{"name":"Europe","id":"OQ==-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},{"term":{"name":"Greece Debt Crisis","id":"ZmEzMmRmNDAtNDc0Zi00ODk3LWE2ZmQtZWFmYzJlZTRjZTVk-VG9waWNz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"topics"}},{"term":{"name":"News","id":"Nw==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}},{"term":{"name":"Text","id":"ZjMwY2E2NjctMDA1Ni00ZTk4LWI0MWUtZjk5MTk2ZTMyNGVm-TWVkaWFUeXBlcw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"mediaType"}}],"authors":[{"term":{"name":"Peter Spiegel","id":"Q0ItMDAwMTMyMQ==-QXV0aG9ycw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"authors"}}],"brand":[],"genre":[{"term":{"name":"News","id":"Nw==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}}],"icb":[{"term":{"name":"2795 Financial Administration","id":"NTg=-SUNC","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"icb"}}],"iptc":[{"term":{"name":"04008019 -
