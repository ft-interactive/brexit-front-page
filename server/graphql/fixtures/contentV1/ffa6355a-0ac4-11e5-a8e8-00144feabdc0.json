An eccentric oligarch who built his vast metals and mining company Mechel during the <a title=\"Russia’s miners bear burden of pre-crisis buying spree - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8565850-e7ee-11e2-babb-00144feabdc0.html#slide0\">commodity boom years</a>, Mr Zyuzin was on the verge of losing it to his creditors.</p>\n<p>After billions of dollars worth of ill-advised deals Mechel had become mired in more than $8bn of debt (since reduced to $7bn by devaluation), an amount more than 10 times the size of its market capitalisation, just as prices for its products were in a slump.</p>\n<p>At a meeting in the summer of last year, Herman Gref, the powerful head of Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, finally lost his temper when confronted with Mr Zyuzin’s stubborn refusal to recognise his company’s impending failure. “Now you’re my enemy for life,” Mr Gref told the oligarch, according to two people familiar with the encounter.</p>\n<p>It was a pivotal moment for Mr Zyuzin. An old-school manager, he had run some of Mechel’s assets since the days of the Soviet Union, before building the group into one of the country’s largest metals operations. But it also marked\n\na turning point for <a title=\"Russia news headlines - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/topics/places/Russia\">Russia</a>: if Mr Gref prevailed, Mechel would become the largest corporate bankruptcy in the country’s history and a test case for its financial system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#a\">‘Zyuzin tries to understand the tiniest detail’ — Read the view from Chelyabinsk </a>\n</p>\n<p>With the two men still at loggerheads one year on, the tussle over Mechel epitomises a hard-fought struggle between two competing visions of Russia: on the one hand, Mr Zyuzin’s Soviet-style focus on maintaining production growth and keeping his 70,000 employees happy; on the other, Mr Gref’s liberal drive to turn Russia into a market where banks can make a return and struggling businesses are allowed to fail.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Life support </h3>\n<p>The clash is playing out against the backdrop of a <a title=\"Russia: Border tensions - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2cf60498-0e14-11e5-8ce9-00144feabdc0.html\">geopolitical stand-off</a> with the west, sanctions and a lower oil price.

He has struck deals with two of the banks, and the final holdout, Sberbank, has softened its position in recent public comments.</p>\n<p><img height=\"360\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/fde0b776-1380-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.img\"/>“It has been decided by the Kremlin that the most important thing is stability in the system,” says Chris Weafer, a senior partner at the Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory. Against this backdrop, the bankruptcy of a company like Mechel “might have a contagious effect and destabilise the economy and hurt the investment climate”.</p>\n<p>The likely continuation of the status quo highlights how anxiety about social unrest has made the Kremlin even more conservative as it attempts to navigate the current<a title=\"Russian retail sales and real wages plummet - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bb1b04de-009b-11e5-a8e0-00144feabdc0.html\"> economic decline</a>.</p>\n<p>“The government doesn’t want the noise of a company with 70,000 employees going bankrupt,” says one person close to Mechel. “Especially against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.”</p>\n<p>The fact that Mr Zyuzin, a divisive, chain-smoking manager, has pulled himself back from the brink is also a testament to the oligarch’s particular talents as a corporate Houdini who has survived everything from the personal wrath of President Vladimir Putin to several near-cases of bankruptcy. </p>\n<p>One of the last “red directors”, or Soviet-era factory bosses, to still run corporate empires in today’s Russia, Mr Zyuzin has proved himself to be patriotic but also reluctant to adapt to the modern way of doing business. A former miner, he does not own a smartphone or a computer, preferring his secretary to print out his emails so he can annotate them in pencil. The pencil-annotated missive is scanned and sent back to the recipient.\n\n</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>While his personal fortune was once estimated at $9bn, Mr Zyuzin is at the more abstemious end of the oligarchy scale: he does not own foreign villas, yachts or football clubs. One of his favourite tipples is a bottle of New World white wine that retails for under $20. Other tycoons collect Lamborghinis and Impressionist art; Mr Zyuzin collects postage stamps.</p>\n<p>Born in 1960 in Kimovsk, about 200km south of Moscow, Mr Zyuzin started work as a mining engineer in the mid-1980s before moving to southwestern Siberia to work at Raspadskaya, one of the country’s largest coal mines. </p>\n<p>When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 he was deputy director of the mine and within two years had created a coal export trading company. By 1997 he and a partner, Vladimir Iorich, had bought a controlling stake in the Southern Kuzbass coal mining operation. Over the subsequent years, they expanded further and, in 2004, Mechel, by then Russia’s fourth-largest coal producer and fifth-largest steel manufacturer, was floated on the New York Stock Exchange with a valuation of $2.9bn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Digging for deals </h3>\n<p>Together Mr Zyuzin and Mr Iorich made the perfect team, former company executives and bankers recall. Mr Zyuzin, with his forensic knowledge of the mining sector, delved into the details of Mechel’s production, while the financially adept Mr Iorich looked after the business side. All that changed in 2006 when Mr Iorich sold his stake\n. “With Iorich gone, Zyuzin was on his own,” says a former Mechel executive. “There was no one to put him in his place.”</p>\n<p><img height=\"360\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/082f11dc-1381-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.img\"/>Alone at the helm, Mr Zyuzin embarked on a buying spree until the summer of 2008: paying $2.3bn for control of the coking coal assets of Yakutugol and Elagaugol in eastern Siberia; $1.5bn for the London-listed miner Oriel Resources; and started negotiations for a more than half a billion dollar takeover of Bluestone Coal of the US.</p>\n<p>Everything was on track until he missed an appointment, due to illness, with Mr Putin on July 26 2008, just as commodity prices began to slide. “Of course, sickness is sickness,” Mr Putin said, “but I think Igor Vladimirovich [Zyuzin] should get better as quick as possible, otherwise we’ll have to send him a doctor.”</p>\n<p>The remarks sent Mechel’s New York shares down by more than a third. A few weeks later, the company and the rest of the world were hit by the global financial crisis. The 2010-11 recovery in commodity prices offered a reprieve. But Mr Zyuzin took it as a buying opportunity.</p>\n<p>“When the crisis of 2009 ended, we [in the top management] thought we should freeze things for a bit and focus on the assets we had,” says a former top manager at Mechel. “Igor Vladimirovich thought that, because everyone else had stopped, we should run even faster.”</p>\n<p>In 2010, Mechel signed agreements to buy steel plants in Turkey and Romania and acquired control of a Bulgarian power station. The following year it announced it would be paying over $500m for the Donetsk Electrometallurgical Plant in eastern Ukraine. </p>\n<p>When commodity prices began falling again in 2011, those deals looked foolhardy. “As a manager [Zyuzin] is fantastic,” says one senior state banker. “He knows the business inside out. But he’s a guy who cannot make solid business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Colleagues note how Mr Zyuzin insists on calling up each of his plant directors personally to get the latest output figures. More than one compares his system of management with that of Mr Putin: a world where many decisions can only be made at the very top and loyalty is prized above effectiveness. As one ex-Mechel executive puts it: “You can lose millions for the business but still keep your job if you follow orders.”</p>\n<p>Mr Zyuzin declined to comment for this article. But <a title=\"Oleg Korzhov to take over at Mechel following Mikhel resignation - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7dced514-721d-11e3-9c5c-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk\">Oleg Korzhov,</a> Mechel’s chief executive, defended the businessman’s record in an interview with the Financial Times.</p>\n<p>“Everything that we acquired — it wasn’t candy factories” or something frivolous, he says. “These were all assets that would theoretically have fit nicely into Mechel’s production and sales structure. If it had not been for the crisis we would have finished our investment projects in a year or two and been in a different financial situation.”</p>\n<p>Mechel realised the mistake of its acquisitions within a year, after coking coal prices fell sharply in 2011 and 2012. But by then it was too late. While the company began to dispose of some of its assets in 2012 and 2013, including Bluestone, its creditors lost patience.</p>\n<p>Faced with western sanctions and volatile markets following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Mechel’s three main creditors — Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank — began to play hardball. By last June, they were pressing Mr Zyuzin to accept a deal to convert the company’s debt into equity, a move that would have left the oligarch with a minority stake. At meetings last summer, they tried to push him to accept the deal but the oligarch refused, leading to his showdown with Sberbank’s Mr Gref.</p>\n<p><img height=\"294\" alt=\"Mechel receipt price\" width=\"306\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/c08f8614-1375-11e5-aa7f-00144feabdc0.img\"/>By the end of the summer, the government appeared to have had enough. In September, Alexei Ulyukaev, the economy minister, declared that he saw “no other way out” for Mechel but bankruptcy. Soon after VTB and Sberbank filed Russian court claims against Mechel for not servicing its debt. These cases are still being processed.</p>\n<p>Mr Zyuzin became more recalcitrant, ignoring some requests for information from the banks, one state banker says. By autumn, Mechel’s share price was down 99 per cent from its 2008 peak, as investors anticipated the worst. In 2008 it had a market capitalisation in New York of about $24bn but is now valued at$508m.</p>\n<p>But, as the Russian economy lurched into recession, the political winds began to change. Suddenly economic and social stability was more important to the Kremlin than dealing with a troublesome oligarch; the banks themselves were facing problems of survival that eclipsed the dispute with Mr Zyuzin.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">Too big to fail</h3>\n<p>“In the summer it was just Mechel . . . it was like a sore thumb,” says one senior state banker. “Now when your whole hand is hurting you don’t notice the pinky so much.” By December, the rouble’s slide had become a rout, claiming Trust Bank, a high street lender, and UTair, Russia’s third-largest airline, and forcing the government to backstop the entire banking sector.</p>\n<p>In late January, Russia’s trade and industry minister added Mechel to a list of “systemically important” Russian companies eligible for state support. In recent months Mr Zyuzin has managed to come to agreements with two of the creditors — Gazprombank and VTB. Mr Gref last month told Vedomosti, the FT’s Russian sister paper, that he hoped Sberbank would come to a final agreement with Mechel by the end of June. \n</p>\n<p><img height=\"360\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" class=\"ft-web-inline-picture\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/0fdcf174-1381-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.img\"/>Sberbank is expected to continue its efforts to force Mr Zyuzin to either give up financial control of the company or relinquish the power to appoint its chief executive. But the bank may not see the negotiations through to their conclusion: Mr Gref has suggested it may try to sell its $1.3bn of Mechel debt to VTB, Gazprombank or a third party.</p>\n<p>Some in Moscow question Mr Zyuzin’s fate and say he \nwould not have survived were it not for the support of someone high-ranking in the elite.</p>\n<p>“Obviously someone is behind him,” says one senior Russian banker. “Otherwise he wouldn’t have the guts to stand up to three [state] banks like this.”</p>\n<p>The reality may be more prosaic. “In the government, [Zyuzin] has a reputation of a state businessman who is helping to develop Russian business and the economy,” says a former Mechel executive. “He’s not buying foreign football clubs or investing in foreign property.”</p>\n<p>The Kremlin’s favour and the leniency of state banks have allowed Mr Zyuzin to avoid the fate of his competitors, such as Patriot Coal of the US, which last month filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years. Indeed, if he retains ownership of Mechel, he will be well placed to regain his billions should coal prices recover.</p>\n<p>“Why should the company stay with Zyuzin? Because he created it,” says Mr Korzhov. </p>\n<p><a></a>\n</p>\n<p>“It’s his child basically. You don’t want to give up your child to another mother.” </p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"dataTable\" data-asset-name=\"asset2\"></aside><p>\n</p>"},"lifecycle":{"initialPublishDateTime":"2015-06-15T18:01:30Z","lastPublishDateTime":"2015-06-15T18:01:30Z"},"location":{"uri":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ffa6355a-0ac4-11e5-a8e8-00144feabdc0.html"},"summary":{"excerpt":"Igor Zyuzin’s Mechel mining and metals group has debts of $7bn but the Kremlin cannot afford to let it collapse"},"packaging":{"spHeadline":"Russian economy – An asset to the state"},"master":{"masterSource":"Methode","masterEntityId":"ffa6355a-0ac4-11e5-a8e8-00144feabdc0"},"editorial":{"otherTitles":["Russian economy: An asset to the state"],"subheading":"The Kremlin cannot afford to let the Mechel mining group collapse","standFirst":"Igor Zyuzin’s Mechel mining and metals group has debts of $7bn but the Kremlin cannot afford to let it collapse","byline":"Courtney Weaver and Jack Farchy"},"provenance":{"originatingParty":"FT"},"metadata":{"primarySection":{"term":{"name":"The Big Read","id":"MTE4-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},"primaryTheme":{"term":{"name":"Mechel OAO","id":"T05fbnlzZS1leHRyYV9mZXYtMjAwOF8xMTAz-T04=","attributes":[{"key":"wsod_key","value":"ru:MTLR"},{"key":"is_company","value":"true"}],"taxonomy":"organisations"}},"tags":[{"term":{"name":"The Big Read","id":"MTE4-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},{"term":{"name":"Mechel OAO","id":"T05fbnlzZS1leHRyYV9mZXYtMjAwOF8xMTAz-T04=","attributes":[{"key":"wsod_key","value":"ru:MTLR"},{"key":"is_company","value":"true"}],"taxonomy":"organisations"}},{"term":{"name":"Analysis","id":"MQ==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}},{"term":{"name":"Text","id":"ZjMwY2E2NjctMDA1Ni00ZTk4LWI0MWUtZjk5MTk2ZTMyNGVm-TWVkaWFUeXBlcw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"mediaType"}},{"term":{"name":"Patriot Coal Corp","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"us:PCX"}]}},{"term":{"name":"Sberbank Rossii OAO","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"ru:SBER"}]}},{"term":{"name":"Glencore PLC","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"uk:GLEN"}]}},{"term":{"name":"UTair Aviation OAO","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"ru:TMAT"}]}},{"term":{"name":"Gazprombank OJSC","attributes":[]}},{"term":{"name":"Mechel OAO","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"ru:MTLR"}]}},{"term":{"name":"Oriel Resources PLC","attributes":[]}},{"term":{"name":"VTB Bank OAO","attributes":[{"key":"FTSymbol","value":"ru:VTBR"}]}}],"authors":[{"term":{"name":"Jack Farchy","id":"Q0ItMDAwMDcxOA==-QXV0aG9ycw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"authors"}}],"brand":[],"genre":[{"term":{"name":"Analysis","id":"MQ==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}}],"icb":[{"term":{"name":"1770 Mining","id":"MjU=-SUNC","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"icb"}},{"term":{"name":"1771 Coal","id":"MjY=-SUNC","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"icb"}}],"iptc":[{"term":{"name":"04004007 -

The factory is about to start producing up to 400,000 tonnes a year of track for <a title=\"Russia Business &amp; Finance related stories - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Russia_Business_%26_Finance\">Russia</a>’s new high-speed railways, which will be able to withstand the extreme climate. Winter temperatures go as low as -60C. </p>\n<p>Another of Mr Zyuzin’s mega projects is Elga, one of the world’s largest coking coal deposits, located in Russia’s far east and with 2.2bn tonnes of estimated reserves.</p>\n<p>The project is ambitious for any private company, let alone one with $7bn debt. But for some in the government, it has solidified Mr Zyuzin’s reputation as a businessman who wants to do projects that are good for the country, even if they are not immediately commercially viable.</p>\n<p>Says Mr Kapnin: “Only a person who isn’t scared of challenges can set a task like creating Elga.”</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"}}],"mediaAssets":[]}}
