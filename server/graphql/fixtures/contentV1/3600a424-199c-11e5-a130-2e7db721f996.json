That is politics for you. But it has nothing to do with the pressing problems <a title=\"London Guide in-depth - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/londonguide\">London</a> faces in transport policy.</p>\n<p>It is 12 years since the congestion charge was introduced in London — yet the centre of the city is often at a standstill, sometimes for reasons that defy common sense. I recently counted 15 buses on the Strand, which runs east from Trafalgar Square all the way to the Law Courts. Six of them were empty. The capital has more than 66,000<a title=\"Addison Lee and Uber united against plans to cap private taxis - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/94f482f4-0086-11e5-b91e-00144feabdc0.html\"> private hire drivers</a>\n, distinct from black cabs, summoned all over the city centre by <a title=\"A safety net fit for the sharing economy - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1d854de-169f-11e5-b07f-00144feabdc0.html\">iPhone apps</a> or controllers in grubby offices. Do we need so many? And who truly believes that the planned “cycle superhighway” along Victoria Embankment will do anything but slow the snake of cars along the river to a near standstill? Not everyone cycles, Mr Johnson. </p>\n<p><a title=\"London is too great a city for any politician to shape it - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcb8ab76-1510-11e5-a587-00144feabdc0.html\">London</a>’s often imbecilic transport arrangements are a serious problem for a global city that is the engine of the British economy and a magnet to commercial companies and creative geniuses who want to live and work in the country. That allure remains powerful. But we dare not take it for granted. A city that is impossible to move around rapidly loses its charm for men and women who can afford to live anywhere. </p>\n<p>Consider the buses, grinding their way pointlessly around the city’s 19,500 bus stops. The contracting out of London’s bus services was launched 30 years ago, when London Buslines took over route 81. Now private operators run all 700 of the capital’s routes. </p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, this is not privatisation but competitive tendering; though private companies handle the running of the routes, they still receive subsidy from the taxpayer, which in 2013 worked out at about 15p every time someone made a journey. Yet empty buses on the Strand contribute nothing except gridlock. The contracts drawn up for operators ought to penalise such failures. A company that is routinely sending out buses to tour London without a single passenger should face financial sanctions.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>The same logic should apply to roadworks. Transport for London, the government body responsible for most of the capital’s public transport, collates a central register of disruption on its website. This is pointless; it is near the works themselves that the warnings need to be displayed and well in advance. Too often they are not. Worse, the works are frequently unmanned and, like empty buses, contribute nothing but inertia. </p>\n<p>We should limit much more clearly the length of time that can be spent digging up a road, with tough fines for those who miss their targets. </p>\n<p>When distilled to its basics, modern political discourse is often the same question rephrased in many ways: when is it appropriate for the government or other public authorities to be involved in the operations of the market? Transport is an area where the energy of competition and efficiency of the private sector should be harnessed. But public regulation is just as important. Would it not make sense, say, for delivery trucks over a certain size to be told to deliver between midday and 5pm, and not in daytime at all for the largest vehicles? Of course, there would be exceptions: medical supplies, for example. And it might be feasible for the regulations to be waived for a hefty antisocial delivery charge, with proceeds going to London’s public transport budget. </p>\n<p>What is woefully apparent is that these questions have not been seriously addressed. London’s transport policy is a national issue. The next mayor needs to tackle this problem head on, take hard decisions and seek legislation if necessary. Let us hope she or he offers more than a winning smile and a bike.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\">The writer is chairman of EL Rothschild</span>\n</p>\n<p> . . . </p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Letters in response to this article:</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p><a title=\"Many modern city dwellers do not own a car or even learn to drive -
